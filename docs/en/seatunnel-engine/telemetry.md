# Telemetry

Integrating `Metrices` through `Prometheus-exports` can better seamlessly connect to related monitoring platforms such
as Prometheus and Grafana, improving the ability to monitor and alarm of the SeaTunnel cluster.

You can configure telemetry's configurations in the `seatunnel.yaml` file.

The following is an example declarative configuration.

```yaml
seatunnel:
  engine:
    telemetry:
      metric:
        enabled: true # Whether open metrics export
```

## Metrics

The [metric text of prometheus](./telemetry/metrics.txt),which get
from `http://{instanceHost}:5801/hazelcast/rest/instance/metrics`.

The [metric text of openMetrics](./telemetry/openmetrics.txt),which get
from `http://{instanceHost}:5801/hazelcast/rest/instance/openmetrics`.

Available metrics include the following categories.

Note: All metrics both have the same labelName `cluster`, that's value is the config of `hazelcast.cluster-name`.

## Cluster Monitoring By Prometheus & Grafana

### Install Prometheus

For a guide on how to set up Prometheus server go to
the [Installation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation)

### Configuration Prometheus

Add seatunnel instance metric exports into `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml`. For example:

```yaml
global:
  # How frequently to scrape targets from this job.
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  # The job name assigned to scraped metrics by default.
  - job_name: 'seatunnel'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    # Metrics export path 
    metrics_path: /hazelcast/rest/instance/metrics
    # List of labeled statically configured targets for this job.
    static_configs:
      # The targets specified by the static config.
      - targets: [ 'localhost:5801' ]
      # Labels assigned to all metrics scraped from the targets.
      # labels: [<labelName>:<labelValue>]
```

### Install Grafana

For a guide on how to set up Grafana server go to
the [Installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation)

### Monitoring Dashboard

- Add Prometheus DataSource on Grafana.
  - Import `Seatunnel Cluster` monitoring dashboard by [Dashboard JSON](./telemetry/grafana-dashboard.json) into Grafana.
