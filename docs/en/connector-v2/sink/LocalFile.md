# LocalFile

> Local file sink connector

## Description

Output data to local file.

:::tip

If you use spark/flink, In order to use this connector, You must ensure your spark/flink cluster already integrated hadoop. The tested hadoop version is 2.x.

If you use SeaTunnel Engine, It automatically integrated the hadoop jar when you download and install SeaTunnel Engine. You can check the jar package under ${SEATUNNEL_HOME}/lib to confirm this.

:::

## Key features

- [x] [exactly-once](../../concept/connector-v2-features.md)

By default, we use 2PC commit to ensure `exactly-once`

- [x] file format type
  - [x] text
  - [x] csv
  - [x] parquet
  - [x] orc
  - [x] json
  - [x] excel

### path [string]

The target dir path is required.

### custom_filename [boolean]

Whether custom the filename

### file_name_expression [string]

Only used when `custom_filename` is `true`

`file_name_expression` describes the file expression which will be created into the `path`. We can add the variable `${now}` or `${uuid}` in the `file_name_expression`, like `test_${uuid}_${now}`,
`${now}` represents the current time, and its format can be defined by specifying the option `filename_time_format`.

Please note that, If `is_enable_transaction` is `true`, we will auto add `${transactionId}_` in the head of the file.

### filename_time_format [string]

Only used when `custom_filename` is `true`

When the format in the `file_name_expression` parameter is `xxxx-${now}` , `filename_time_format` can specify the time format of the path, and the default value is `yyyy.MM.dd` . The commonly used time formats are listed as follows:

| Symbol |    Description     |
|--------|--------------------|
| y      | Year               |
| M      | Month              |
| d      | Day of month       |
| H      | Hour in day (0-23) |
| m      | Minute in hour     |
| s      | Second in minute   |

### file_format_type [string]

We supported as the following file types:

`text` `json` `csv` `orc` `parquet` `excel`

Please note that, The final file name will end with the file_format_type's suffix, the suffix of the text file is `txt`.

### field_delimiter [string]

The separator between columns in a row of data. Only needed by `text` file format.

### row_delimiter [string]

The separator between rows in a file. Only needed by `text` file format.

### have_partition [boolean]

Whether you need processing partitions.

### partition_by [array]

Only used when `have_partition` is `true`.

Partition data based on selected fields.

### partition_dir_expression [string]

Only used when `have_partition` is `true`.

If the `partition_by` is specified, we will generate the corresponding partition directory based on the partition information, and the final file will be placed in the partition directory.

Default `partition_dir_expression` is `${k0}=${v0}/${k1}=${v1}/.../${kn}=${vn}/`. `k0` is the first partition field and `v0` is the value of the first partition field.

### is_partition_field_write_in_file [boolean]

Only used when `have_partition` is `true`.

If `is_partition_field_write_in_file` is `true`, the partition field and the value of it will be write into data file.

For example, if you want to write a Hive Data File, Its value should be `false`.

### sink_columns [array]

Which columns need be write to file, default value is all of the columns get from `Transform` or `Source`.
The order of the fields determines the order in which the file is actually written.

### is_enable_transaction [boolean]

If `is_enable_transaction` is true, we will ensure that data will not be lost or duplicated when it is written to the target directory.

Please note that, If `is_enable_transaction` is `true`, we will auto add `${transactionId}_` in the head of the file.

Only support `true` now.

### batch_size [int]

The maximum number of rows in a file. For SeaTunnel Engine, the number of lines in the file is determined by `batch_size` and `checkpoint.interval` jointly decide. If the value of `checkpoint.interval` is large enough, sink writer will write rows in a file until the rows in the file larger than `batch_size`. If `checkpoint.interval` is small, the sink writer will create a new file when a new checkpoint trigger.

### compress_codec [string]

The compress codec of files and the details that supported as the following shown:

- txt: `lzo` `none`
- json: `lzo` `none`
- csv: `lzo` `none`
- orc: `lzo` `snappy` `lz4` `zlib` `none`
- parquet: `lzo` `snappy` `lz4` `gzip` `brotli` `zstd` `none`

Tips: excel type does not support any compression format

### common options

Sink plugin common parameters, please refer to [Sink Common Options](common-options.md) for details.

### max_rows_in_memory [int]

When File Format is Excel,The maximum number of data items that can be cached in the memory.

### sheet_name [string]

Writer the sheet of the workbook

### enable_header_write [boolean]

Only used when file_format_type is text,csv.false:don't write header,true:write header.

## Example

For orc file format simple config

```bash

LocalFile {
    path = "/tmp/hive/warehouse/test2"
    file_format_type = "orc"
}

```

For parquet file format with `sink_columns`

```bash

LocalFile {
    path = "/tmp/hive/warehouse/test2"
    file_format_type = "parquet"
    sink_columns = ["name","age"]
}

```

For text file format with `have_partition` and `custom_filename` and `sink_columns`

```bash

LocalFile {
    path = "/tmp/hive/warehouse/test2"
    file_format_type = "text"
    field_delimiter = "\t"
    row_delimiter = "\n"
    have_partition = true
    partition_by = ["age"]
    partition_dir_expression = "${k0}=${v0}"
    is_partition_field_write_in_file = true
    custom_filename = true
    file_name_expression = "${transactionId}_${now}"
    filename_time_format = "yyyy.MM.dd"
    sink_columns = ["name","age"]
    is_enable_transaction = true
}

```

For excel file format with `sheet_name` and `max_rows_in_memory`

```bash

LocalFile {
    path="/tmp/seatunnel/excel"
    sheet_name = "Sheet1"
    max_rows_in_memory = 1024
    partition_dir_expression="${k0}=${v0}"
    is_partition_field_write_in_file=true
    file_name_expression="${transactionId}_${now}"
    file_format_type="excel"
    filename_time_format="yyyy.MM.dd"
    is_enable_transaction=true
  }

```
