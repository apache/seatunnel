# Protobuf Format

Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) is a language-neutral, platform-independent data serialization format developed by Google. It provides an efficient way to encode structured data and supports multiple programming languages and platforms.

Currently, Protobuf format can be used with Kafka.

## Field Name Matching

The schema field names and the proto field names are declared independently, so they are not required to use the same case. Every schema field is resolved against the protobuf descriptor as follows:

- The exact name is matched first, so a proto file that declares mixed case field names such as `C_INT32` is still resolved exactly.
- Only when there is no exact match, a case-insensitive fallback is used. The fallback is locale independent, so a schema field such as `C_String` matches `string c_string = 6;` even under a locale such as Turkish, and the same resolution is used when reading and when writing.
- Nested types are resolved against the descriptor that owns them: the fields of a `ROW` column are matched against the message type of the protobuf field the column maps to, and the entries of a `MAP` column are matched against the map entry descriptor of that field.

A non-null schema field without a matching proto field fails the job when writing, and is read as `null` when reading.

## Kafka Usage Example

- Example of simulating a randomly generated data source and writing it to Kafka in Protobuf format

```hocon
env {
    parallelism = 1
    job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
   FakeSource {
      parallelism = 1
      plugin_output = "fake"
      row.num = 16
      schema = {
        fields {
          c_int32 = int
          c_int64 = long
          c_float = float
          c_double = double
          c_bool = boolean
          c_string = string
          c_bytes = bytes

          Address {
              city = string
              state = string
              street = string
          }
          attributes = "map<string,float>"
          phone_numbers = "array<string>"
        }
      }
    }
}

sink {
  kafka {
      topic = "test_protobuf_topic_fake_source"
      bootstrap.servers = "kafkaCluster:9092"
      format = protobuf
      kafka.request.timeout.ms = 60000

        acks = "all"
        request.timeout.ms = 60000
        buffer.memory = 33554432
      }
      protobuf_message_name = Person
      protobuf_schema = """
              syntax = "proto3";

              package org.apache.seatunnel.format.protobuf;

              option java_outer_classname = "ProtobufE2E";

              message Person {
                int32 c_int32 = 1;
                int64 c_int64 = 2;
                float c_float = 3;
                double c_double = 4;
                bool c_bool = 5;
                string c_string = 6;
                bytes c_bytes = 7;

                message Address {
                  string street = 1;
                  string city = 2;
                  string state = 3;
                  string zip = 4;
                }

                Address address = 8;

                map<string, float> attributes = 9;

                repeated string phone_numbers = 10;
              }
              """
  }
}
```
